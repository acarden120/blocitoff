  # available as additional gems.

  # ==> Configuration for any authentication mechanism

  # ==> Configuration for :encryptable
  # Allow you to use another encryption algorithm besides bcrypt (default). 
  # :authlogic_sha512 (then you should set stretches above to 20 for default behavior)

  # ==> Scopes configuration

  # end

  # ==> Mountable engine configurations
  # When using Devise inside an engine, let's call it `MyEngine`
  #     mount MyEngine, at: '/my_engine'
  #
  # The router that invoked `devise_for`, in the example above, would be:
  # config.router_name = :my_engine
  #
  # Devise cannot automatically set Omniauth path,
  # so you need to do it manually.
